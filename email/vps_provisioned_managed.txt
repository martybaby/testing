Login Credentials
=================

The VPS login details are as follows:

Please note that your Plesk Panel comes with a pre-installed with a self-signed SSL Certificate and as such you may be presented with a warning message by your web-browser. This is not something you should be alarmed about, though you should ensure that the URL you are visiting is definitely that of your VPS (https://$HOSTNAME:8443). It is also perfectly normal for there to be more information in the address bar after the 8443.

Nameserver Information
======================

 ns1.nufuturenet.com - 141.0.160.1
 ns2.nufuturenet.com - 50.56.214.58

SSH (Secure Shell) Access
=========================

Shell Access: $HOSTNAME (Please note that by default all shell access is disabled, see below for further information)
Root Password: $PASSWORD

To connect to your server via SSH (Secure Shell) you would use a client such as PuTTY on Windows, or the in-built Terminal application on Mac OS X or Linux. Direct root access is disabled on your server to aid security (a common practice), to connect via SSH you would be required login to SSH as your FTP user for a domain, and then, if required escalate to root privileges by executing the command "su -" and typing in your root password (provided on your initial provisioning email with all your login details). To reset your FTP credentials and turn on Shell access for a domain you would first login to your Plesk Hosting Control Panel, select the relevant Webspace and browse to Websites & Domains --> Web Hosting Access --> User Account, you would then then select '/bin/bash' (or your preferred Shell) from the dropdown box under 'Access to the server over SSH' to enable Shell access for this domain. You can use either $HOSTNAME or an IP address associated with your server for the value of your hostname. If there is a specific task you wish to undertake but are unsure how we are happy to provide free advice and guidance prior to your making changes as opposed to charging to undo damage to the server afterwards!
