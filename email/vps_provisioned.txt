Please find enclosed all the information you need to get started with your VPS
below.

=================

The VPS login details are as follows:

Please note that your Plesk Panel comes with a pre-installed with a
self-signed SSL Certificate and as such you may be presented with a warning
message by your web-browser. This is not something you should be alarmed
about, though you should ensure that the URL you are visiting is definitely
that of your VPS (https://$HOSTNAME:8443). It is also perfectly normal for
there to be more information in the address bar after the 8443.

Nameserver Information
======================

 ns1.nufuturenet.com - 141.0.160.1
 ns2.nufuturenet.com - 50.56.214.58

SSH (Secure Shell) Access
=========================

Shell Access: $HOSTNAME (Please note that by default all shell access is
disabled, see below for further information)
Root Password: $PASSWORD

To connect to your server via SSH (Secure Shell) you would use a client such
as PuTTY on Windows, or the in-built Terminal application on Mac OS X or
Linux. Direct root access is disabled on your server to aid security (a common
practice), to connect via SSH you would be required login to SSH as your FTP
user for a domain, and then, if required escalate to root privileges by
executing the command "su -" and typing in your root password (provided on
your initial provisioning email with all your login details). To reset your
FTP credentials and turn on Shell access for a domain you would first login to
your Plesk Hosting Control Panel, select the relevant Webspace and browse to
Websites & Domains --> Web Hosting Access --> User Account, you would then
then select '/bin/bash' (or your preferred Shell) from the dropdown box under
'Access to the server over SSH' to enable Shell access for this domain. You
can use either $HOSTNAME or an IP address associated with your server for the
value of your hostname. If there is a specific task you wish to undertake but
are unsure how we are happy to provide free advice and guidance prior to your
making changes as opposed to charging to undo damage to the server afterwards!
